## Repository Pattern â€” Why Use It

This project implements the **Repository Pattern** to abstract the data access layer from the business logic layer.

### Why you should consider using the Repository Pattern:

- **Cleaner Code Structure**: keeping controllers and services focused on business logic rather than database queries.
- **Improved Testability**: easily mock repository methods during unit testing, making the tests faster and more reliable.
- **Centralized Logic**: reuse common database operations across different parts of your application by centralizing them in the repository.
- **Flexibility and Decoupling**: we can switch data sources with minimal changes to the rest of the code.
- **Scalability**: we can maintain and scale large codebases more easily when responsibilities are clearly separated.
